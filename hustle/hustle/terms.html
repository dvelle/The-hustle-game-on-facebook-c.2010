        <p> <strong>14. OTHER GENERAL PROVISIONS</strong> <br />
          <br />
          These Terms are for the benefit of SMG and the Providers, its and their  officers, directors, employees, affiliated or related entities, agents,  licensors, and suppliers. Each of these individuals or entities shall  have the right to assert and enforce these Terms directly against you  on its (or their own) behalf. SMG's failure to act with respect to a  breach by you or others does not waive SMG's right to act with respect  to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or  unenforceable, such provision will be struck and the remaining  provisions enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only.</p>

These franchisees are independent contractors, and no agency,  partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee  relationship is intended or created by these Terms.</p>
        <p>The provisions and conditions of these Terms, and each obligation  referenced herein, represent the entire Agreement between SMG  (including the Providers), its affiliated or related entities, and You,  and supersede any prior agreements or understandings not incorporated  herein. In the event that any inconsistencies exist between these Terms  and any future published terms of use or understanding, the last  published Terms shall prevail.</p>

        <p>c) Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Terms (&quot;Dispute&quot;), you and BeThereSMG agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.

        <p>d) Binding Arbitration. If you and BeThereSMG are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or BeThereSMG may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

The determination of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, BeThereSMG will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and BeThereSMG may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
        <p>e) Restrictions. You and BeThereSMG agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between BeThereSMG and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
        <p>f) Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and BeThereSMG agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or BeThereSMGâs intellectual property rights; (2) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
        <p>13) Waiver/Severability</p>
        <p>a) The failure of BeThereSMG to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of BeThereSMG's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p>
        <p>b) You and BeThereSMG agree that if any portion of these Terms, except any portion of section 12(e), is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect. If Section 12(e) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor BeThereSMG will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of Section 12(e) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of San Francisco, State of California, United States of America, and you and BeThereSMG agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
        <p>14) Miscellaneous</p>

The information provided on the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject BeThereSMG to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
