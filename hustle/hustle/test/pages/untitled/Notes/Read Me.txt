# Intro
#####################################
This is a simple project that can be studied and implemented into
your site or web application to provide a richer user expirience.

Often when dealing with a database there are too many records to
display on the screen at once, so creating pages can both improve
page load speed and page readability. To many results at once can
be confusing and make pages too long. This is a simple way to 
page your results without requiring your user to reload the entire
page.

(visit www.dlmonitor.com for more details), we wanted to learn 
AJAX as well as help others learn, we also have a new project
