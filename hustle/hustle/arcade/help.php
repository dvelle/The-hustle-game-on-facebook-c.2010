<p><strong>Welcome to the City of Bliss.</strong></p>
<p>Day 1 you're a LEVEL 1- Rookie living in your mom's basement (losing respect the longer you stay) with your fists the only weapons you have to work with.</p>
<p>Here in the &quot;ARCADE&quot; is where you earn cash and respect by beating arcade high-scores, or you could just sit back and let your crew work it.</p>
<p>RESPECT is measured by the amount of COOL POINTS(CP)</p>
<p>- The higher your arcade score the more cash and/or CP you earn...though the game you beat is not guaranteed to give you anything.</p>
<p>- The more cool points(CP) you earn the higher your level, the higher your level, the more energy you have and the more influence you have over the CASH FLOW of your crew.</p>
<p>- Once you get a crew, you share your cash and they share their cash with you...every time they win cash in the arcade or from a robbery you automatically get 25% and you also give them 25% every time you get that paper, but you're in a crew anytime you lose money 25% of it comes from your crew and well anytime they lose 25% comes from your pockets. After you reach <strong>LEVEL 1 - Upstart</strong> you will be able to change these percentages and so will they.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Once you get your paper and respect up, make your way to the &quot;MAKE SOME CASH&quot; area to bet big bucks you can beat other Hustlers to a FAIR( that is, high score wins) or DIRTY(that is, you're going to rob them regardless of the outcome) game of your choosing.</p>
<p>- <strong>Be Cautious: </strong>Your reputation tanks the more ill-will you spread...but there's a fix for that; purchase property to stabilize your reputation and you can get away with anything&nbsp;without the consequences taking away from your level.</p>
<p>- And finally don't just add anyone to your crew, you need cash and only savvy Players will earn it for you..only recruit those that will add to your bill-fold....but be warned a player having a bad week can drain your cash reserves as well.</p>
<p><strong>This is a game of tactics and strategy</strong>...define your Hustle&nbsp;to become and maintain your status as you rise to become a Kingpin.</p>
